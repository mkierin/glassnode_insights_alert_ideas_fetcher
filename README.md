# Alert Idea Extractor

This Python script extracts "Alert Idea:" text and associated links from a list of webpages and saves the extracted information into a CSV file.

## Description

The script uses the `requests` library to fetch the HTML content of the webpages and the `BeautifulSoup` library from `bs4` to parse the HTML content. It searches for paragraphs containing "Alert Idea:" and extracts the text and link associated with it. The script then saves the extracted data into a CSV file using the `pandas` library.

## Installation

To use this script, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Additionally, you need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


This assumes you have a requirements.txt file in your project directory with the following content:

requests
beautifulsoup4
pandas


## Usage
Update the webpages list in the script with the URLs of the webpages you want to extract "Alert Idea:" content from.
Run the script using the following command:

python alert_idea_extractor.py


The extracted "Alert Idea:" text and links will be saved in a CSV file named alert_ideas.csv in the same directory as the script.


Make sure to save this content in a file named `README.md` in your project directory. The markdown format will render nicely on GitHub.
